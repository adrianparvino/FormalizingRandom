\section{Introduction}
This research paper aims to introduce an approach to experimental design that utilizes
simulated random experiments or experiments that require semi-random sampling.

Back in 2015, Bohannon wrote a blog post about
a faux research that got through multiple peer reviews
despite being severely flawed by p-hacking \cite{fooledchocolate}.
This calls for a more systematic way of approaching research --
the problem is known, therefore a solution should be sought.

This research will provide a methodology that allows for research to be reproducible, hence verifiable,
and formalized.
These two properties must not be apart.
An unformalized research may have been specifically designed to be misleading, while
an unreproducible research is unable to be verified post hoc.
